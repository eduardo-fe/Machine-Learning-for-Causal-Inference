#Machine Learning for Causal Inference.

This repository contains materials for an introductory course on Machine Learning (ML) for Causal Inference. The lesson introduces key concepts such as Neyman Orthogonality, Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML), and Cross-Fitting, addressing challenges in applying ML methods for causal inference.The lesson is based on a Beamer presentation created using R Markdown, with accompanying R code for simulations and visualizations. The materials are designed for researchers, students, or practitioners interested in causal inference and ML.
