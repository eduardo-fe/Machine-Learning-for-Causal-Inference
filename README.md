# Machine Learning for Causal Inference

This repository contains materials for a **three-lecture introductory course** on applying Machine Learning (ML) methods to Causal Inference problems.

The course is designed for researchers, students, and practitioners who want to combine modern ML techniques with rigorous causal inference methods.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

### **Lesson 1 â€” Neyman Orthogonality & Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML)**
- Concept of Neyman orthogonality and why it matters for causal estimation.
- Introduction to Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML).
- Cross-fitting to reduce overfitting bias in causal parameter estimation.
- R code demonstrations with simulations and visualizations.

### **Lesson 2 â€” Estimation Under Ignorability**
- Using ML to flexibly estimate nuisance parameters (propensity scores, outcome models).
- Combining ML estimators with causal estimators under unconfoundedness.
- Practical implementation examples.

### **Lesson 3 â€” Instrumental Variables (IV) & Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)**
- Applying ML in IV settings (e.g., two-stage estimation with flexible learners).
- ML for sharp and fuzzy RDD estimation.
- Practical coding examples.
